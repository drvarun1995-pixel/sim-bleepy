## 🗄️ Database Setup

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: You must run these migrations before the booking system will work!**

### Step 1: Connect to Supabase

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard: https://app.supabase.com
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar

### Step 2: Run Migrations in Order

Run these SQL files **in this exact order**:

#### Migration 1: Add Event Booking Fields
```bash
File: migrations/add-event-booking-fields.sql
```
- Adds booking configuration columns to the `events` table
- Takes ~2 seconds to complete
- You should see: "✅ Event Booking Fields Added Successfully!"

#### Migration 2: Create Event Bookings Table
```bash
File: migrations/create-event-bookings-table.sql
```
- Creates the `event_bookings` table
- Sets up auto-updating timestamps
- Takes ~3 seconds to complete
- You should see: "✅ Event Bookings Table Created Successfully!"

#### Migration 3: Create Booking Statistics View
```bash
File: migrations/create-booking-stats-view.sql
```
- Creates the `event_booking_stats` view for admin dashboards
- Takes ~2 seconds to complete
- You should see: "✅ Booking Statistics View Created Successfully!"

#### Migration 4: Setup RLS Policies
```bash
File: migrations/setup-booking-rls-policies.sql
```
- Enables Row Level Security on event_bookings
- Creates 6 policies for proper access control
- Takes ~2 seconds to complete
- You should see: "✅ RLS Policies Created Successfully!"

### Step 3: Verify Migrations

Run this query to verify everything is set up:

```sql
-- Check if booking fields exist on events table
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'events' 
AND column_name LIKE 'booking%';

-- Check if event_bookings table exists
SELECT EXISTS (
  SELECT FROM information_schema.tables 
  WHERE table_name = 'event_bookings'
);

-- Check if event_booking_stats view exists
SELECT EXISTS (
  SELECT FROM information_schema.views 
  WHERE table_name = 'event_booking_stats'
);
```

**Expected Results:**
- 9 booking columns on events table
- `event_bookings` table exists: `true`
- `event_booking_stats` view exists: `true`
