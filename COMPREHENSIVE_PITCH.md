# Sim-Bleepy: Complete Medical Education Teaching Marketplace
## Comprehensive Pitch Document

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**Sim-Bleepy** is a comprehensive teaching marketplace platform that connects medical students with quality educational resources, live teaching events, and organized learning experiences. We centralize all aspects of medical education—teaching sessions, bedside teaching, grand rounds, OSCE practice, teaching files, and portfolio management—into one seamless platform, making medical education more accessible, organized, and effective.

**The Problem:** Medical education is fragmented across multiple platforms, email chains, WhatsApp groups, and outdated calendars. Students miss important teaching sessions, educators struggle to track attendance, and valuable teaching resources get lost in email threads. There's no centralized system to manage the entire medical education experience.

**Our Solution:** A unified teaching marketplace that brings together events, resources, educators, and learners in one platform. Students discover and attend teaching sessions, access curated resources, build their portfolios, and track their progress—all in one place. As a bonus, we've integrated an AI patient simulator for additional clinical skills practice.
