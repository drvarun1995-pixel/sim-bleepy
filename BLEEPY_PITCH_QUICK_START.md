## 🎯 **Quick Reference: The Pitch Structure**

### **60-Second Breakdown:**

**0:00-0:09** → **HOOK**
> "Last week, two medical students missed a teaching session because it was posted in three different WhatsApp groups, multiple email chains and an Excel rota that nobody really checked."

**0:09-0:21** → **PROBLEM & NHS CONNECTION**
> "Hi, I'm **Varun Tyagi**, Clinical Teaching Fellow at Basildon Hospital. I hear the students frustration and educators struggling to organise everything. It's not just inefficient—it's impacting how well we train the future NHS doctors."

**0:21-0:35** → **SOLUTION & TARGET USERS**
> "That's why I built **Bleepy**—an online platform where students get everything in one place: sessions, resources, the world's first emotional AI patient simulator, and interactive quiz games. On the other hand educators get one dashboard that handles everything, reducing admin workload by 95%!"

**0:35-0:49** → **COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE & TRACTION**
> "Generic platforms in the market force everyone onto one crowded site. Bleepy gives you your own branded platform. Guess what? We're already live at Basildon Hospital, serving medical students from ARU and UCL."

**0:49-1:00** → **IMPACT & CTA**
> "Every missed teaching session means a missed opportunity—a problem Bleepy seeks to solve. Visit sim.bleepy.co.uk to see it in action."

## 🎬 **Recommended Filming Approach**

**For best results, use this combination:**

1. **Option 1: Talking Head + Screen Demo** (Most Professional)
   - Start with you speaking (0:00-0:25)
   - Show Bleepy platform demo (0:25-0:50)
   - End with you speaking (0:50-1:00)

2. **Option 2: Pure Talking Head** (Most Authentic)
   - You speaking directly to camera entire time
   - Requires strong delivery, but most authentic

**Avoid:**
- ❌ Only screen recording without you (less personal)
- ❌ Too many visual effects (distracts from message)
- ❌ Low-quality production (hurts credibility)

---

## 🎤 **Delivery Reminders**

- **Pace:** Not too fast, not too slow. Natural conversational speed.
- **Pauses:** Use brief pauses for emphasis (especially after "Bleepy")
- **Emphasis:** Stress key words: Bleepy, exclusive, centralizes, live, NHS
- **Energy:** Show enthusiasm, especially when discussing impact
- **Confidence:** You built this! Show pride in your work

---

## 📞 **Key Information to Remember**

- **Your Name:** Varun Tyagi (introduce yourself!)
- **Your Role:** Clinical Teaching Fellow at Basildon Hospital
- **Platform Name:** Bleepy (say it clearly!)
- **Target Users:** Two groups - learners (medical students) and educators (people who want to deliver teaching)
- **Competitive Advantage:** Unlike cluttered sites, Bleepy can be reused by different institutions to create their own branded platform
- **For Students:** Never miss sessions, organized resources, portfolio building
- **For Educators:** One dashboard, attendance tracking, resource sharing, analytics
- **Website:** sim.bleepy.co.uk (mention at end)
- **Traction:** Live at Basildon Hospital, serving ARU & UCL
- **Impact:** Better-trained doctors → better patient care

## 🆘 **Quick Troubleshooting**

### **Problem: Can't remember script**
→ **Solution:** Use cue card. Practice section by section.

### **Problem: Going over 60 seconds**
→ **Solution:** Cut less essential details. Focus on core message.

### **Problem: Speaking too fast**
→ **Solution:** Practice with pauses. Breathe between sentences.

### **Problem: Not showing enough energy**
→ **Solution:** Practice as if telling exciting news to a friend.

### **Problem: Technical issues (lighting, audio)**
→ **Solution:** Test everything before recording. Use phone if camera has issues.
