## üîß How to Fix Organizer Deletion

### Quick Fix (3 Steps)

#### Step 1: Run SQL Script ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL
```bash
1. Open Supabase Dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Open file: fix-organizers-deletion-comprehensive.sql
4. Copy ALL contents
5. Paste into SQL Editor
6. Click "Run"
7. Check output - should see multiple result tables
```

#### Step 2: Verify RLS is Disabled
Look for this in the SQL output:

| tablename | RLS Enabled |
|-----------|-------------|
| organizers | f (false) |
| event_organizers | f (false) |

If you see `t` (true), the script didn't execute properly.

#### Step 3: Test Deletion
```bash
1. Go to /event-data
2. Edit any event
3. Remove an organizer (click X)
4. Click "Update Event"
5. Wait for success message
6. Refresh page (F5)
7. Edit same event
8. Organizer should still be removed ‚úì
```

## üîç If Still Not Working

### Debug Checklist

1. **Check Browser Console** (F12)
   - Look for red errors
   - Note any "RLS" or "permission denied" messages

2. **Check Network Tab** (F12 ‚Üí Network)
   - Find the update request
   - Check request payload
   - Check response status (should be 200)

3. **Check Supabase Logs**
   - Dashboard ‚Üí Logs ‚Üí Database
   - Look for errors during update
   - Note any foreign key violations

4. **Run Verification Queries**
   All verification queries are included in the SQL script

### Common Issues

**"Permission denied for table event_organizers"**
- SQL script should fix this
- If not, grant permissions manually (see debug guide)

**"Changes revert on refresh"**
- RLS is blocking the delete
- Ensure SQL script ran successfully
- Check output shows RLS disabled

**"violates foreign key constraint"**
- Check if organizer is primary organizer (main field)
- Only "other organizers" can be removed this way
