# Security Definor Fix Guide

## üîí **Issue Fixed**
The `event_booking_stats` view was created with `SECURITY DEFINER`, which means it runs with the permissions of the view creator rather than the querying user. This can lead to privilege escalation and bypass Row Level Security (RLS) policies.

## ‚úÖ **Solution Applied**
1. **Dropped and recreated the view** without `SECURITY DEFINER`
2. **Added `security_invoker = true`** to ensure RLS policies are properly enforced
3. **Maintained all existing functionality** while improving security

## üß™ **Testing Checklist**

### **Before Running the Migration:**
1. **Note current behavior**: Check what booking statistics are visible to different user roles
2. **Document any issues**: Note if users can see booking data they shouldn't have access to

### **After Running the Migration:**

#### **1. Test User Role Permissions**
- [ ] **Student User**: Should only see booking stats for events they have access to
- [ ] **Educator User**: Should see booking stats for events they manage
- [ ] **Admin User**: Should see all booking statistics
- [ ] **MEDED_TEAM User**: Should see booking stats for events they manage
- [ ] **CTF User**: Should see booking stats for events they manage

#### **2. Test Booking Statistics Display**
- [ ] **Dashboard**: Booking statistics display correctly
- [ ] **Bookings Page**: Event booking stats show proper counts
- [ ] **Individual Event Booking Page**: Statistics load without errors
- [ ] **API Endpoints**: `/api/bookings/stats` returns correct data

#### **3. Test RLS Enforcement**
- [ ] **Cross-user data access**: Users cannot see booking stats for events they don't have access to
- [ ] **Soft-deleted bookings**: Properly excluded from statistics
- [ ] **Cancelled bookings**: Counted separately in cancelled_count
- [ ] **Available slots**: Calculated correctly based on confirmed bookings only

#### **4. Test Edge Cases**
- [ ] **Events with no bookings**: Show 0 counts correctly
- [ ] **Events with full capacity**: Available slots show 0
- [ ] **Events with waitlist**: Waitlist count displays properly
- [ ] **Large datasets**: Performance remains acceptable

## üîç **Specific Test Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Student Access**
1. Login as a student user
2. Navigate to `/bookings` page
3. **Expected**: Should only see booking stats for events they have access to
4. **Verify**: Cannot see booking details for restricted events

### **Scenario 2: Admin Access**
1. Login as an admin user
2. Navigate to `/bookings` page
3. **Expected**: Should see all booking statistics
4. **Verify**: Can see all events with booking enabled

### **Scenario 3: API Access**
1. Make API call to `/api/bookings/stats` with different user roles
2. **Expected**: Returns data appropriate to user's permissions
3. **Verify**: No unauthorized data exposure

### **Scenario 4: Booking Counts**
1. Create test bookings with different statuses
2. Check booking statistics display
3. **Expected**: Counts match actual booking statuses
4. **Verify**: Soft-deleted bookings are excluded

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Rollback Plan**
If issues occur, you can rollback by:
1. Dropping the new view
2. Recreating with SECURITY DEFINER (temporary)
3. Investigating and fixing the underlying RLS issues

```sql
-- Emergency rollback (use only if needed)
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS event_booking_stats;
CREATE VIEW event_booking_stats AS
-- [original definition with SECURITY DEFINER]
```

## üéØ **Success Criteria**
- [ ] Security Advisor shows no SECURITY DEFINER warnings
- [ ] All booking statistics display correctly
- [ ] RLS policies are properly enforced
- [ ] No performance degradation
- [ ] All existing functionality works as expected

## üìù **Post-Migration Verification**
1. Check Supabase Security Advisor - should show 0 errors
2. Test booking system functionality end-to-end
3. Verify user role permissions are working correctly
4. Monitor for any new errors in logs
