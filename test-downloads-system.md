# 🧪 Test Downloads System

## ✅ What Should Work Now:

1. **Main Resources API**: `/api/resources` should return your uploaded files
2. **Download Counts API**: `/api/downloads/counts` should return zero counts (no more 500 error)
3. **Downloads Page**: Should display your uploaded files
4. **File Upload**: Should work for admins/educators/CTF/meded_team
5. **File Download**: Should work for all authenticated users

## 🧪 Test Steps:

### **Test 1: Check API Directly**
1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/api/resources` in your browser
2. You should see JSON data with your uploaded file
3. No 500 errors

### **Test 2: Check Downloads Page**
1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/downloads`
2. You should see your uploaded file listed
3. No console errors about failed API calls

### **Test 3: Test File Download**
1. Click on a file to download it
2. File should download properly
3. No errors in console

### **Test 4: Test File Upload**
1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/downloads/upload`
2. Upload a new file
3. File should appear on downloads page

## 🐛 Known Issues (Not Critical):

1. **Favicon Error**: `GET http://localhost:3000/favicon.ico [HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error]`
   - This is unrelated to the downloads system
   - Just means the favicon file is missing
   - Doesn't affect functionality

2. **Dark Mode Error**: `TypeError: can't access property "customDarkModeManagerCS", e.NSSS is undefined`
   - This is a browser extension or theme issue
   - Not related to our downloads system
   - Doesn't affect functionality

## 🎯 Expected Result:

Your downloads system should now work perfectly:
- ✅ Files display on the downloads page
- ✅ Files can be downloaded
- ✅ Files can be uploaded (for authorized users)
- ✅ No more 500 errors from the API
- ✅ Proper permissions enforced

The system is ready to use! 🚀
