## 📝 **Script (Concise Version)**

**HOOK (9s):**
> "Last week, two medical students missed a teaching session because it was posted in three different WhatsApp groups, multiple email chains and an Excel rota that nobody really checked."

**PROBLEM & NHS CONNECTION (12s):**
> "Hi, I'm **Varun Tyagi**, Clinical Teaching Fellow at Basildon Hospital. I hear the students frustration and educators struggling to organise everything. It's not just inefficient—it's impacting how well we train the future NHS doctors."

**SOLUTION & TARGET USERS (14s):**
> "That's why I built **Bleepy**—an online platform where students get everything in one place: sessions, resources, the world's first emotional AI patient simulator, and interactive quiz games. On the other hand educators get one dashboard that handles everything, reducing admin workload by 95%!"

**COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE & TRACTION (14s):**
> "Generic platforms in the market force everyone onto one crowded site. Bleepy gives you your own branded platform. Guess what? We're already live at Basildon Hospital, serving medical students from ARU and UCL."

**IMPACT & CTA (11s):**
> "Every missed teaching session means a missed opportunity—a problem Bleepy seeks to solve. Visit sim.bleepy.co.uk to see it in action."
