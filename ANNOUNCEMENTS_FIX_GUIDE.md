# Announcements Feature - Complete Fix Guide

## üîß Issues Fixed

### 1. **Failed to Create/Update Announcements**
**Problem**: Row Level Security (RLS) policies were blocking operations because they use `auth.uid()` (Supabase Auth) but we're using NextAuth.

**Solution**: Disabled RLS on the announcements table since we handle all permissions in the API routes.

### 2. **Deleted Announcements Coming Back**
**Problem**: Local state wasn't properly syncing with the database after deletion.

**Solution**: Added automatic refetch after deletion to ensure consistency.

### 3. **Date Picker Not Loading**
**Problem**: Type mismatch between `Date | null` and the Calendar component's expected `Date | undefined`.

**Solution**: Changed state type from `Date | null` to `Date | undefined` throughout the component.

### 4. **Better Error Logging**
**Problem**: Errors weren't providing enough detail for debugging.

**Solution**: Added comprehensive error logging in all API routes with detailed error messages.

## üìã Required Steps

### Step 1: Run the RLS Fix Script

**Open Supabase SQL Editor and run this script:**

```sql
-- Drop existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can read active announcements" ON announcements;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Educators and admins can create announcements" ON announcements;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Author and admins can update announcements" ON announcements;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Author and admins can delete announcements" ON announcements;

-- Disable RLS for announcements table since we're using NextAuth and handling permissions in API routes
ALTER TABLE announcements DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

**Why?** The original RLS policies use `auth.uid()` which only works with Supabase Auth. Since we're using NextAuth, we handle all permissions in the API routes instead.

### Step 2: Verify the Fix

1. **Restart your development server** (if it's running)
2. **Navigate to** `/dashboard/announcements`
3. **Test creating an announcement:**
   - Fill in title and content
   - Click the date picker - it should now open properly
   - Select a priority - you should see nice colors
   - Click "Create Announcement"
   - Should succeed without errors

4. **Test updating an announcement:**
   - Click the settings icon on an announcement
   - Modify any fields
   - Click "Update Announcement"
   - Should update successfully

5. **Test deleting an announcement:**
   - Click the X icon on an announcement
   - Confirm deletion
   - Announcement should disappear and not come back after refresh

## üß™ Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create announcement works
- [ ] Date picker opens and selects dates
- [ ] Priority colors display correctly
- [ ] Update announcement works
- [ ] Delete announcement works
- [ ] Deleted announcements don't reappear after refresh
- [ ] Error messages are clear and helpful
- [ ] Only admins and educators can access the page
- [ ] Admins can edit/delete all announcements
- [ ] Educators can only edit/delete their own announcements

---

## üö® Important Notes

1. **RLS is now disabled** on the announcements table. All permissions are enforced in the API routes.
2. **NextAuth session** is used for authentication, not Supabase Auth.
3. **Service role key** is used by the Supabase client in API routes, bypassing RLS.
4. **Date picker** requires `Date | undefined` type, not `Date | null`.

---

## üìù If Issues Persist

If you still encounter issues, check the following:

1. **Browser Console**: Look for error messages
2. **Server Console**: Check for API error logs
3. **Network Tab**: Inspect API request/response
4. **Supabase Logs**: Check for database errors

Common issues:
- **"Permission denied"**: RLS might still be enabled - run the fix script again
- **"Table not found"**: Run the initial `create-announcements-schema.sql` script
- **Date picker not opening**: Clear browser cache and restart dev server
- **"Failed to create"**: Check server console for detailed error message
