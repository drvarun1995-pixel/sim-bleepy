## üöÄ How to Enable (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Run Database Migration
Copy and execute in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- From: migrations/add-profile-picture-and-bio-fields.sql

ALTER TABLE users 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS profile_picture_url TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS profile_picture_updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS about_me TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS tagline VARCHAR(255);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_users_profile_picture_url 
ON users(profile_picture_url) WHERE profile_picture_url IS NOT NULL;
```

### Step 2: Create Storage Bucket
**Option A - Dashboard (Recommended)**:
1. Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Create bucket
2. Name: `profile-pictures`
3. Check: Public bucket
4. Click Create

**Option B - SQL**:
```sql
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public, file_size_limit, allowed_mime_types)
VALUES ('profile-pictures', 'profile-pictures', true, 3145728, 
        ARRAY['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/webp'])
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;
```

### Step 3: Set Storage RLS Policies
Copy and execute in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- From: migrations/setup-profile-pictures-bucket.sql

CREATE POLICY "Users can upload their own profile picture"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'profile-pictures' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own profile picture"
ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'profile-pictures' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own profile picture"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'profile-pictures' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);

CREATE POLICY "Public read access to profile pictures"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'profile-pictures');
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Upload fails with "Failed to upload"
**Solution**: 
1. Check storage bucket exists and is named `profile-pictures`
2. Verify bucket is public
3. Check all 4 RLS policies are created

### Issue: "Permission denied" error
**Solution**:
1. Verify user is authenticated
2. Check RLS policies are active
3. Test `auth.uid()` in Supabase SQL

### Issue: Image doesn't display
**Solution**:
1. Check bucket public setting
2. Verify public read policy exists
3. Check browser console for CORS errors

### Issue: Compression too aggressive
**Solution**:
Increase `maxSizeMB` from 0.3 to 0.4 or 0.5
