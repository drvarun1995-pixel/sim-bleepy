## 🎬 **Full 1-Minute Pitch Script**

**[OPENING - Hook (9 seconds)]**

"Last week, two medical students missed a teaching session because it was posted in three different WhatsApp groups, multiple email chains and an Excel rota that nobody really checked.

**[PROBLEM & NHS CONNECTION - 12 seconds]**

Hi, I'm **Varun Tyagi**, Clinical Teaching Fellow at Basildon Hospital. I hear the students frustration and educators struggling to organise everything. It's not just inefficient—it's impacting how well we train the future NHS doctors.

**[SOLUTION & TARGET USERS - 14 seconds]**

That's why I built **Bleepy**—an online platform where students get everything in one place: sessions, resources, the world's first emotional AI patient simulator, and interactive quiz games. On the other hand educators get one dashboard that handles everything, reducing admin workload by 95%!

**[COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE & TRACTION - 14 seconds]**

Generic platforms in the market force everyone onto one crowded site. Bleepy gives you your own branded platform.

Guess what? We're already live at Basildon Hospital, serving medical students from ARU and UCL.

**[IMPACT & CALL TO ACTION - 11 seconds]**

Every missed teaching session means a missed opportunity—a problem Bleepy seeks to solve. Visit sim.bleepy.co.uk to see it in action."

## 📝 **Alternate Version (More Conversational)**

**[OPENING]**

"Hi, I'm **Varun Tyagi**, Clinical Teaching Fellow at Basildon Hospital. I've seen first-hand how fragmented medical education delivery is—students miss teaching because it's spread across emails, WhatsApp, and messy Excel sheet rotas, while educators struggle to track attendance and share resources effectively.

**[SOLUTION & USERS]**

That's why I built **Bleepy**—a platform serving two groups: learners who want to access teaching, and educators who want to deliver it.

For students: Never miss sessions with automated notifications, access organized resources, and build portfolios—all centralized.

For educators: One dashboard to manage everything—track attendance, share resources, and see engagement analytics.

**[COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE]**

What makes Bleepy unique? Instead of one cluttered website where everyone posts together, Bleepy can be reused by different institutions to create their own branded educational platform. Each site gets their dedicated space.

**[TRACTION & IMPACT]**

We're already live at Basildon Hospital, serving students from ARU and UCL. This means better-trained doctors, more efficient NHS medical education, and ultimately, better patient care.

**[CTA]**
