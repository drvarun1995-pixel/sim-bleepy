# AI Description Generation Examples

## How to Use Additional AI Instructions for Event Descriptions

The smart bulk upload now automatically generates comprehensive event descriptions for all events. You can also provide specific instructions to customize the descriptions.

### Basic Usage
When you upload a file, the AI will automatically generate descriptions that include:
- Learning objectives
- What participants will learn
- Key topics covered
- Target audience
- Expected outcomes

### Additional AI Instructions Examples

#### 1. General Description Enhancement
```
Make all descriptions more detailed and include specific learning outcomes for each event.
```

#### 2. Target Specific Audience
```
Focus descriptions on Foundation Year Doctors and include practical clinical skills they will gain.
```

#### 3. Add Specific Elements
```
Include the following in all descriptions:
- Prerequisites for attendance
- Materials participants should bring
- Assessment methods used
- Follow-up resources available
```

#### 4. Format-Specific Instructions
```
For Core Teaching events, emphasize theoretical knowledge and exam preparation.
For Clinical Skills events, focus on hands-on practice and practical application.
For OSCE Revision events, highlight exam techniques and time management.
```

#### 5. Specialty-Focused Descriptions
```
Tailor descriptions to medical specialties:
- Cardiology events: focus on heart conditions and treatments
- Emergency Medicine events: emphasize rapid assessment and decision-making
- Paediatrics events: highlight child-specific considerations
```

#### 6. Interactive Elements
```
Include interactive elements in descriptions:
- Case studies participants will work through
- Group discussions planned
- Hands-on demonstrations
- Q&A sessions with experts
```

### Example Output

**Input Event Title:** "Cardiology Grand Round"

**AI-Generated Description:**
```
This comprehensive cardiology session provides Foundation Year Doctors with essential knowledge of cardiovascular conditions and treatments. Participants will learn to identify common cardiac presentations, interpret ECG findings, and understand evidence-based treatment protocols. The session covers acute coronary syndromes, heart failure management, and arrhythmia recognition. Through interactive case studies and expert-led discussions, attendees will develop clinical reasoning skills and gain confidence in cardiac assessment. This session is ideal for those preparing for clinical rotations and examinations, offering practical insights from experienced cardiologists.
```

### Tips for Better Descriptions

1. **Be Specific:** Instead of "make descriptions better," specify what elements you want included.

2. **Target Audience:** Mention the specific audience (Foundation Year Doctors, Medical Students, etc.).

3. **Learning Outcomes:** Ask for specific learning objectives or skills participants will gain.

4. **Format Context:** Reference the event format (Grand Round, Clinical Skills, etc.) for context-appropriate descriptions.

5. **Specialty Focus:** If events are specialty-specific, mention the medical specialty for targeted content.

### Example Instructions for Different Scenarios

#### For Medical Education Events
```
