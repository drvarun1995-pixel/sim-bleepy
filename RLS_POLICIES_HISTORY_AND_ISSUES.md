## Overview

Row Level Security (RLS) policies were repeatedly implemented, dropped, and re-implemented throughout the project due to fundamental architectural mismatches and access control issues.

## Major RLS Problems Encountered

### **Problem 1: NextAuth vs Supabase Auth Mismatch** 🔴 CRITICAL

**The Core Issue:**
- Your app uses **NextAuth** for authentication
- RLS policies check `auth.uid()` from **Supabase Auth**
- Since you don't use Supabase Auth, `auth.uid()` always returns **NULL**
- Result: **All RLS policies failed, blocking everyone including admins**

**Architecture Mismatch:**
```
Your App:
User → NextAuth → Next.js API → Supabase (via service role)

What RLS Expected:
User → Supabase Auth → Direct DB queries → RLS checks auth.uid()
```

**Impact:**
- ❌ Nobody could access anything
- ❌ Admins were blocked
- ❌ All features stopped working
- ❌ Emergency fixes required

### **Problem 2: Organizer Deletion Failures** 🟠 HIGH PRIORITY

**The Issue:**
- Organizers couldn't be deleted from events
- Deletions appeared successful but reverted on refresh
- RLS policies blocking deletions on junction tables

**Root Causes:**
1. RLS enabled on `event_organizers` junction table
2. RLS enabled on `organizers` table
3. RLS enabled on `event_locations` table
4. Missing CASCADE delete permissions
5. Conflicting policies preventing DELETE operations

**Impact:**
- ❌ Event management broken
- ❌ Users couldn't remove organizers
- ❌ Data integrity issues

**Solution:**
- Disabled RLS on all related tables
- Added proper CASCADE delete rules
- Granted permissions to all roles

### **Problem 3: Educator Role Access Blocked** 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY

**The Issue:**
- Educators couldn't upload resources
- Educators couldn't view their own content
- RLS policies too restrictive

**Root Causes:**
1. RLS policies only allowed admins
2. No policies for educator role
3. Service role access blocked by RLS

**Impact:**
- ❌ Educators couldn't use resource upload
- ❌ Core functionality broken
- ❌ User complaints

**Solution:**
- Created role-based helper functions
- Added educator-specific policies
- Disabled RLS on shared tables

### **Problem 4: Leaderboard Data Access Issues** 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY

**The Issue:**
- Leaderboard couldn't display user data
- Gamification features broken
- XP tracking not visible

**Root Causes:**
1. RLS blocking public leaderboard access
2. Policies preventing cross-user data reads
3. Service role queries blocked

**Impact:**
- ❌ Leaderboard empty
- ❌ Gamification broken
- ❌ User engagement features down

**Solution:**
- Dropped restrictive policies
- Created public read policies
- Allowed service role access

- `fix-leaderboard-rls-safe.sql`
- `fix-leaderboard-rls.sql`

---

### **Problem 5: New Roles (MedEd Team, CTF) Blocked** 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY

**The Issue:**
- New roles added but couldn't access features
- RLS policies didn't include new roles
- Permission denied errors everywhere

**Root Causes:**
1. RLS policies hardcoded for old roles only
2. No helper functions for role checking
3. Policies needed updating for each new role

**Impact:**
- ❌ New roles unusable
- ❌ Features inaccessible
- ❌ Manual policy updates required

**Solution:**
- Created role-based helper functions
- Updated all policies to use helpers
- Made system extensible for future roles

- `FIX_NEW_ROLES_PERMISSIONS.md`

## Why RLS Policies Were Dropped

### **Tables Where RLS Was Disabled:**

#### **Shared/Public Data Tables:**
- ✅ `events` - Authorization in API layer
- ✅ `categories` - Public lookup data
- ✅ `formats` - Public lookup data
- ✅ `locations` - Public lookup data
- ✅ `organizers` - Public lookup data
- ✅ `speakers` - Public lookup data
- ✅ `event_speakers` - Junction table
- ✅ `event_locations` - Junction table
- ✅ `event_organizers` - Junction table
- ✅ `resources` - Authorization in API layer
- ✅ `contact_messages` - Authorization in API layer
- ✅ `announcements` - Authorization in API layer

**Reason:** 
- All access via Next.js API routes
- APIs use service role key (bypasses RLS)
- Authorization checked in API layer
- NextAuth session validation
- Role-based permission helpers

#### **User-Specific Tables (RLS Kept):**
- ✅ `users` - Service role only
- ✅ `profiles` - User isolation required
- ✅ `portfolio_files` - User isolation required
- ✅ `attempts` - User isolation required
- ✅ `user_levels` - User isolation required
- ✅ `user_achievements` - User isolation required

**Reason:**
- Need user data isolation
- Service role access only
- APIs filter by user_id
- Privacy protection required

### **Permission Helpers (API Layer):**

```typescript
// lib/permissions.ts
export function canManageEvents(role: string): boolean {
  return ['admin', 'meded_team', 'ctf'].includes(role)
}

export function canManageResources(role: string): boolean {
  return ['admin', 'meded_team', 'ctf', 'educator'].includes(role)
}

export function canViewContactMessages(role: string): boolean {
  return ['admin', 'meded_team', 'ctf'].includes(role)
}
```

### **API Route Example:**

```typescript
// app/api/events/route.ts
export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  // 1. Check session
  const session = await getServerSession(authOptions)
  if (!session?.user?.email) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 })
  }

  // 2. Get user role
  const { data: user } = await supabaseAdmin
    .from('users')
    .select('role')
    .eq('email', session.user.email)
    .single()

  // 3. Check permission
  if (!canManageEvents(user.role)) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Forbidden' }, { status: 403 })
  }

  // 4. Perform action (RLS disabled, service role access)
  const { data, error } = await supabaseAdmin
    .from('events')
    .insert(eventData)

  return NextResponse.json({ data })
}
```

## Lessons Learned

### **1. Architecture Matters** 🎯

**Lesson:** RLS is designed for Supabase Auth, not NextAuth.

**Takeaway:**
- Don't force RLS with incompatible auth systems
- Understand your architecture before implementing security
- Authorization can happen at different layers

---

### **2. Service Role Bypasses RLS** 🔑

**Lesson:** When using service role key, RLS is bypassed anyway.

**Takeaway:**
- RLS only matters for direct client connections
- API-based apps don't need RLS on shared tables
- Service role = full database access

---

### **3. User Isolation vs Authorization** 🔒

**Lesson:** These are different security concerns.

**Takeaway:**
- **User Isolation:** Use RLS (portfolio_files, attempts)
- **Authorization:** Use API layer (events, resources)
- Don't mix the two concerns

---

### **4. Complexity vs Maintainability** ⚖️

**Lesson:** Complex RLS policies are hard to maintain.

**Takeaway:**
- Simple API authorization is easier to understand
- Helper functions make permissions clear
- Code-based permissions are easier to test

---

### **5. Emergency Fixes Create Tech Debt** 🚨

**Lesson:** Quick RLS disables led to security concerns.

**Takeaway:**
- Document why RLS is disabled
- Have a proper security strategy
- Don't just disable without understanding

---

### **6. Test with Real Users** 👥

**Lesson:** RLS issues only appeared when users tried features.

**Takeaway:**
- Test all roles before deploying
- Have test accounts for each role
- Monitor for permission errors
