## 🐛 Common Issues to Check

### Issue: Button Stays Disabled
**Cause:** Download error but state not reset
**Fix:** Check browser console for errors, implemented in finally block

### Issue: Multiple Toasts Appear
**Cause:** Multiple clicks before state sets
**Fix:** Guard clause checks state immediately

### Issue: Toast Doesn't Dismiss
**Cause:** ID mismatch in toast.dismiss()
**Fix:** Using consistent IDs: `file-download-${file.id}` and `zip-download`

### Issue: ZIP Button Always Disabled
**Cause:** No files in portfolio OR downloadingZip stuck true
**Fix:** Check files array length, verify finally block executes
