## ‚ú® Key Improvements

### 1. **Individual File Downloads**
Enhanced the single file download experience with:

#### **Toast Notifications**
- **Loading Stage**: Shows "Preparing download..." with the filename when download starts
- **Progress Stage**: Shows "Download starting..." when file is ready
- **Success Stage**: Shows "File downloaded successfully" with filename after download begins
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages with descriptions if download fails

#### **Visual Indicators**
- **Button Loading State**: Download button shows animated spinner while file is being prepared
- **Disabled State**: Button is disabled during download to prevent duplicate requests
- **Spinner Animation**: Professional loading spinner replaces download icon during processing

#### **Code Implementation**
```typescript
const [downloadingFileId, setDownloadingFileId] = useState<string | null>(null)

const handleDownload = async (file: PortfolioFile) => {
  if (downloadingFileId === file.id) return
  
  setDownloadingFileId(file.id)
  
  // Show loading toast
  toast.loading(`Preparing download...`, {
    description: fileName,
    id: `file-download-${file.id}`,
    duration: 10000,
  })
  
  // ... download logic ...
  
  // Show success
  toast.success('File downloaded successfully', {
    description: fileName,
    duration: 3000,
  })
  
  setDownloadingFileId(null)
}
```

### 2. **ZIP Download (Download Full Portfolio)**
Enhanced the bulk download experience with:

#### **Toast Notifications**
- **Preparation Stage**: "Preparing your portfolio download..." with note about potential wait time
- **Progress Stage**: "Download starting..." when ZIP is ready
- **Success Stage**: "Portfolio downloaded successfully!" with file count
- **Error Handling**: Detailed error messages with descriptions

#### **Visual Indicators**
- **Button Loading State**: Shows spinner and "Preparing ZIP..." text during processing
- **Disabled State**: Button disabled during ZIP creation
- **File Count Feedback**: Success message includes total files packaged
- **Auto-disable**: Button disabled when no files are available

#### **Code Implementation**
```typescript
const [downloadingZip, setDownloadingZip] = useState(false)

const downloadAllFiles = async () => {
  if (downloadingZip) return
  
  setDownloadingZip(true)
  
  // Show loading toast with long duration for large portfolios
  toast.loading('Preparing your portfolio download...', {
    description: 'This may take a moment for large portfolios',
    id: 'zip-download',
    duration: 30000,
  })
  
  // ... ZIP creation logic ...
  
  // Show success with file count
  toast.success('Portfolio downloaded successfully!', {
    description: `${files.length} files packaged into ZIP`,
    duration: 4000,
  })
  
  setDownloadingZip(false)
}
```

## üé® UI/UX Enhancements

### **Loading Spinners**
- Custom animated spinners using Tailwind CSS
- Green theme for download buttons (matching success states)
- White spinner on green button background for visibility

### **Button States**
```tsx
// ZIP Download Button
<Button
  disabled={downloadingZip || files.length === 0}
  className="...disabled:opacity-50 disabled:cursor-not-allowed"
>
  {downloadingZip ? (
    <>
      <div className="w-4 h-4 border-2 border-white border-t-transparent rounded-full animate-spin" />
      Preparing ZIP...
    </>
  ) : (
    <>
      <Download className="w-4 h-4 mr-2" />
      Download Full Portfolio
    </>
  )}
</Button>

// Individual Download Button (Desktop)
<Button
  disabled={downloadingFileId === file.id}
  className="...disabled:opacity-50 disabled:cursor-not-allowed"
>
  {downloadingFileId === file.id ? (
    <div className="w-4 h-4 border-2 border-green-600 border-t-transparent rounded-full animate-spin" />
  ) : (
    <Download className="w-4 h-4 group-hover:scale-110 transition-transform" />
  )}
</Button>
```

### **Toast Progression**

3. **Success** ‚Üí User confirmation that download completed
