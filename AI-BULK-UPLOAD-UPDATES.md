# AI Bulk Upload Updates

## Summary of Changes

The AI bulk upload feature has been updated to provide more comprehensive matching capabilities while removing automatic description generation.

## ✅ **Changes Made:**

### **1. Removed AI Description Generation**
- **Before**: AI automatically generated comprehensive event descriptions
- **After**: Users handle descriptions manually in the review step
- **Reason**: More control over event content and descriptions

### **2. Added Category Matching**
- **New Feature**: AI now matches categories from your database
- **Process**: AI looks for category names in the document and matches them to existing categories
- **Safety**: Only existing categories are assigned, invalid names are skipped

### **3. Added Location Matching**
- **New Feature**: AI now matches locations from your database
- **Process**: AI looks for location names in the document and matches them to existing locations
- **Assignment**: Locations are assigned as additional locations (not main location)
- **Safety**: Only existing locations are assigned, invalid names are skipped

### **4. Changed Organizer Assignment**
- **Before**: AI-assigned organizers were set as main organizers
- **After**: AI-assigned organizers are set as additional organizers
- **Benefit**: Preserves main organizer field for manual assignment

## 🤖 **AI Processing Flow:**

### **1. Document Analysis**
AI analyzes the uploaded document and extracts:
- Event titles, dates, and times
- Speaker names mentioned
- Organizer names mentioned
- Category names mentioned
- Location names mentioned

### **2. Database Matching**
For each extracted name, AI checks against your database:
- **Speakers**: Matches against existing speakers (CTF and Foundation Year Doctors)
- **Organizers**: Matches against existing organizers (32 total)
- **Categories**: Matches against existing categories (ARU, UCL, Foundation Year Doctor, etc.)
- **Locations**: Matches against existing locations (Education Centre, Virtual, etc.)

### **3. Safe Assignment**
- ✅ **Valid matches**: Assigned to events
- ❌ **Invalid names**: Safely skipped with console logging
- 🛡️ **Database protection**: No new entries created
