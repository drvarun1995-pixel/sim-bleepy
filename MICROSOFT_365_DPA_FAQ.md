# Microsoft 365 DPA - Frequently Asked Questions

## Q: I downloaded the DPA from Microsoft Trust Center, but it's not signed. Is this correct?

**A: YES, this is correct!** 

Microsoft's Data Processing Agreement (DPA) is **pre-signed by Microsoft** and does **NOT** require your signature. This is different from other providers like Supabase and Vercel where you need to countersign.

### How Microsoft's DPA Works:

1. **Pre-Signed by Microsoft:** Microsoft signs the DPA on their end
2. **Automatic Acceptance:** By using Microsoft 365 services, you automatically accept the DPA terms
3. **Legally Binding:** The DPA is legally effective without requiring your signature
4. **Part of OST:** The DPA is incorporated into the Microsoft Online Services Terms (OST)

### What This Means:

- ✅ The unsigned DPA you downloaded is the **official, legally binding document**
- ✅ You don't need to sign it or return it to Microsoft
- ✅ It's automatically in effect when you use Microsoft 365 services
- ✅ Save it to your `legal/dpas/` folder for compliance records

## Q: Do I need to do anything else to make the DPA effective?

**A: NO, nothing else is required.**

The DPA is automatically in effect because:
1. You're using Microsoft 365 services (Exchange Online)
2. Microsoft has pre-signed the DPA
3. By using their services, you've accepted the terms

**Just save the downloaded DPA to your records.**

## Q: Why is Microsoft's DPA different from Supabase/Vercel?

**A: Different providers have different processes:**

| Provider | DPA Process |
|----------|-------------|
| **Microsoft 365** | Pre-signed by Microsoft, automatically in effect, no signature needed from you |
| **Supabase** | Requires you to fill out and countersign via PandaDoc |
| **Vercel** | Requires you to fill out and countersign (may be pre-countersigned) |

Microsoft uses a **unilateral agreement** model where they pre-sign and you accept by using their services. Other providers use a **bilateral agreement** model where both parties sign.

## Q: Will auditors accept an unsigned DPA?

**A: YES, auditors understand Microsoft's DPA model.**

For GDPR compliance audits:
- ✅ The unsigned DPA from Microsoft Trust Center is the **official document**
- ✅ You can show that you're using Microsoft 365 services (proving acceptance)
- ✅ You can reference the Microsoft Online Services Terms (OST) which incorporates the DPA
- ✅ Document in your records: "Microsoft DPA - Pre-signed by Microsoft, automatically in effect"

**Best Practice:** Create a note in your compliance documentation explaining:
- Microsoft's DPA is pre-signed by Microsoft
- It's automatically in effect when using Microsoft 365 services
- The downloaded DPA is the official document for your records

---

## Q: Should I contact Microsoft to get a signed version?

**A: NO, this is not necessary.**

Microsoft's standard process is:
- DPA is pre-signed by Microsoft
- Automatically included in the OST
- No countersignature required
- Contacting Microsoft won't change this process

**Exception:** If you have a large enterprise agreement with Microsoft, you might have a custom DPA. But for standard Microsoft 365 subscriptions, the Trust Center DPA is sufficient.

## Q: How do I document this in my compliance records?

**A: Document it like this:**

### In Your DPA Tracking Spreadsheet:

| Processor | DPA Status | Date Downloaded | Date Signed | Notes |
|-----------|------------|----------------|-------------|-------|

## Q: What if I need a countersigned DPA for a specific compliance requirement?

**A: Contact Microsoft Support.**

If you have a specific compliance requirement that demands a countersigned DPA:

1. **Contact Microsoft Support:**
   - Go to: https://support.microsoft.com
   - Explain your specific compliance requirement
   - Request guidance on obtaining a countersigned DPA

2. **Alternative Documentation:**
   - Show your Microsoft 365 subscription agreement
   - Reference the OST (Online Services Terms) which incorporates the DPA
   - Provide evidence of using Microsoft 365 services (proving acceptance)

3. **Legal Opinion:**
   - Consult with your legal/compliance team
   - They can confirm that Microsoft's pre-signed DPA is legally sufficient

**Note:** For standard GDPR compliance, the pre-signed DPA is sufficient. Only contact Microsoft if you have a specific, unusual requirement.
