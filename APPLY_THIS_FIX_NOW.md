# 🚨 URGENT FIX - Apply Immediately

## ⚡ The Problem

You're getting these errors:
```
❌ new row violates row-level security policy for table "organizers"
❌ new row violates row-level security policy for table "events"
❌ new row violates row-level security policy for table "locations"
```

## ✅ The Solution (2 Minutes)

### Step 1: Run This SQL Script

1. Open **Supabase SQL Editor**
2. Open this file: **`migrations/fix-rls-authenticated-user-policies-corrected.sql`**
3. Copy **ALL** contents
4. Paste into SQL Editor
5. Click **Run**

### Step 2: Check It Worked

You should see output like:
```
✅ Policies created successfully
✅ Total authenticated user policies created: 20-24
```

### Step 3: Test It

1. Go to `/event-data` page
2. Try creating a new organizer → ✅ Should work!
3. Try creating a new event → ✅ Should work!

## 🔧 What This Does

- ✅ Allows admin/educator/meded/ctf to create/edit/delete events
- ✅ Allows creating organizers, locations, speakers
- ✅ Maintains security (students still can't manage events)
- ✅ No code changes needed
- ✅ No deployment needed

## ❓ Why Did The First Script Fail?

The first script (`fix-rls-authenticated-user-policies.sql`) tried to create policies for tables that don't exist in your database:
- ❌ `event_categories` (doesn't exist - events has `category_id` column instead)
- ❌ `event_formats` (doesn't exist - events has `format_id` column instead)

The corrected script:
- ✅ Only creates policies for tables that actually exist
- ✅ Checks if junction tables exist before creating policies
- ✅ Uses conditional logic to handle optional tables

---

## 🆘 If You Still Have Issues

Run this to check which tables exist:
```sql
SELECT tablename 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
  AND tablename LIKE 'event%'
ORDER BY tablename;
```

Then let me know what you see!

**File to run:** `migrations/fix-rls-authenticated-user-policies-corrected.sql`

**Time:** 2 minutes

**Risk:** 🟢 Low (only adds policies, doesn't modify existing ones)
