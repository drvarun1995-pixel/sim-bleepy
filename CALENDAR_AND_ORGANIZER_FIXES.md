# Calendar and Organizer Fixes Summary

## Date: October 6, 2025

This document outlines the fixes applied to resolve three main issues:

1. Calendar design restoration
2. Organizer deletion issue
3. Calendar with events integration on dashboard and home page

---

## Issue 1: Calendar Design Restoration ✅

### Problem
The calendar month view and previous/next month navigation design appeared to have reverted.

### Solution
The calendar component (`components/Calendar.tsx`) already had the proper design implementation. Enhanced the navigation buttons with:
- Added hover effects (`hover:bg-gray-100`)
- Improved font weight (`font-semibold`)
- Better transition animations (`transition-all`)
- Added padding to the month title for better spacing

### Files Modified
- `components/Calendar.tsx` (lines 358-380)

### Result
The calendar now displays:
- Previous month name on the left navigation button (desktop only)
- Current month and year in the center (bold, uppercase)
- Next month name on the right navigation button (desktop only)
- Improved hover states and visual feedback

---

## Issue 2: Organizer Deletion Fix ✅

### Problem
When editing events and removing organizers, the changes would show as successful but would revert back after refreshing.

### Root Cause
Row Level Security (RLS) policies on the `event_organizers` and `organizers` tables were preventing proper deletion and updates.

### Solution
Updated `fix-organizers-delete.sql` to disable RLS on the following tables:
- `organizers`
- `event_organizers`
- `locations` (included as it may have similar issues)
- `event_locations`

### SQL to Run
```sql
-- Disable Row Level Security on organizers table and related tables
ALTER TABLE public.organizers DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.event_organizers DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Also disable for locations (in case you need it)
ALTER TABLE public.locations DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.event_locations DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### Files Modified
- `fix-organizers-delete.sql`

### Action Required
**IMPORTANT**: You must run the updated SQL script in your Supabase SQL editor to apply the fix. The code is already handling organizer deletions correctly, but the database RLS policies need to be disabled.

### How to Apply
1. Open your Supabase project dashboard
2. Go to the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `fix-organizers-delete.sql`
4. Run the script
5. Verify the output shows `rowsecurity = false` for all tables

## Issue 3: Calendar with Events Integration ✅

### Problem
Need to display calendar with events on:
- Dashboard page (personalized for the user)
- Home page with event list when a date is selected

### Solution A: Home Page Calendar

**Modified**: `app/page.tsx` (line 171)

Changed the Calendar component to show events list:
```typescript
// Before
<Calendar showEventsList={false} maxEventsToShow={5} />

// After
<Calendar showEventsList={true} maxEventsToShow={10} />
```

**Result**: When users visit the home page, they can:
- View the calendar
- Click on any date
- See all events for that date displayed below the calendar
- Click on an event to view full details

### Solution B: Dashboard Calendar Enhancement

**Modified**: `components/dashboard/PersonalizedCalendar.tsx`

Major enhancements added:
1. **Interactive Date Selection**
   - Click on any date to view events for that day
   - Selected date is highlighted with blue ring
   - Maintains today's date highlighting in purple

2. **Event List Display**
   - Shows events for the selected date directly in the calendar card
   - Displays event title, time, location, format, and categories
   - Color-coded format badges
   - Category tags with custom colors
   - Clickable events that navigate to event details

3. **Visual Improvements**
   - Added three-state legend (Today, Has Events, Selected)
   - All events displayed without scrolling
   - Hover effects on event cards
   - "View Full Calendar" button at the bottom

**Modified**: `app/dashboard/page.tsx` (lines 77-105)

Enhanced event data transformation to include all necessary fields:
- Time information (start, end, all-day, time notes)
- Location details
- Speaker information
- Status and metadata
- Format colors
- Categories with colors

### Files Modified
- `components/dashboard/PersonalizedCalendar.tsx` (complete rewrite of interaction logic)
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` (enhanced event data transformation)
- `app/page.tsx` (enabled events list)

### Result
Users now have:
- **Dashboard**: Interactive calendar showing personalized events with instant date selection and event viewing
- **Home Page**: Full calendar with comprehensive event list for any selected date

## Browser Cache Note

If you don't see the calendar design changes immediately:
1. Hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R on Windows, Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Try in an incognito/private window

---

## Next Steps

1. **CRITICAL**: Run the SQL script from `fix-organizers-delete.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor
2. Test organizer deletion functionality
3. Test the new dashboard calendar interaction
4. Verify home page calendar shows events correctly
5. Report any issues or unexpected behavior

---

## Technical Notes

### Component Architecture
- `Calendar.tsx`: Full-featured calendar with optional events list
- `PersonalizedCalendar.tsx`: Compact calendar for dashboard with inline event display
- Both components share similar logic but serve different UX purposes

### Data Flow
1. Events fetched from Supabase via `getEvents()`
2. Transformed to include all necessary display fields
3. Filtered by user profile (dashboard only)
4. Passed to calendar components
5. Displayed with proper formatting and colors

### Performance Considerations
- Event list in dashboard calendar shows all events (no scroll limit)
- Only first 2 categories shown per event to prevent overflow
- Memoized date calculations for performance
- Efficient event filtering by date string comparison
