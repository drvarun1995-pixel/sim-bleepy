RESEND_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
# OR
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Email notifications will be sent using the configured email service.

- Email failure won't prevent role update
- Users can still use new role even without email

### **New Roles Not Showing:**
- Clear browser cache
- Restart development server
- Check console for errors
- Verify you're logged in as admin

### **Role Update Fails:**
- Check console for error messages
- Verify database has been migrated
- Run the SQL migration: `migrations/add-meded-ctf-roles.sql`

---

## üí° Next Steps

1. **Test in development:**
   - Assign test users to new roles
   - Verify email notifications work
   - Check all permissions function correctly

2. **Run SQL migration** (if not done yet):

   -- Run migrations/add-meded-ctf-roles.sql in Supabase
   ```

3. **Deploy to production:**
   - Push code to production
   - Run SQL migration on production database
