# Booking System Fixes - Applied Today

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… My Bookings Page API Error
**Problem**: "Error fetching bookings: Error: Failed to fetch bookings"

**Root Cause**: The API was trying to query `deleted_at` column that doesn't exist yet in the database.

**Fix**: Temporarily removed `deleted_at` and `deleted_by` from API queries until the soft delete migration is confirmed to have run successfully.

**Files Modified**:
- `app/api/bookings/route.ts` - Removed deleted columns from SELECT and filtering
- `app/api/bookings/event/[eventId]/route.ts` - Removed deleted columns from SELECT

### 2. âœ… Booking Checkbox Still Resetting
**Problem**: "Activate Booking for this Event" checkbox resets to unticked on page refresh, even though booking functionality works (register button appears).

**Root Cause**: The `events_with_details` database view doesn't include the new booking fields, so when loading an event for editing, the booking configuration isn't available.

**Fix**: Created migration to update the `events_with_details` view to include all booking fields.

**Files Created**:
- `migrations/update-events-with-details-add-booking-fields.sql` - Updates the view
- `migrations/check-booking-fields.sql` - Diagnostic script to verify fields exist

## Steps to Fix Everything

### Step 1: Run the Events View Update Migration
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor
-- Copy and paste: migrations/update-events-with-details-add-booking-fields.sql
```

This will:
- Drop and recreate the `events_with_details` view
- Include ALL booking fields in the view
- Ensure booking configuration loads when editing events

### Step 2: Verify Booking Fields Exist (Optional)
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor  
-- Copy and paste: migrations/check-booking-fields.sql
```

This will show you:
- Which booking columns exist in the events table
- Which booking columns exist in the events_with_details view
- Sample data from events with booking configuration

### Step 3: Test the Fixes

#### Test My Bookings Page:
1. Go to `/my-bookings`
2. Should load without errors âœ…
3. Any existing bookings should be visible âœ…

#### Test Booking Checkbox Persistence:
1. Go to event-data page

5. Set booking capacity (e.g., 50)
6. Customize checkbox texts
7. **Save the event**
8. **Refresh the page**
9. Edit the same event again
10. **The booking checkbox should now stay checked!** âœ…
11. **All booking settings should be preserved!** âœ…

#### Test Booking Functionality:
1. Go to an event page where booking is enabled
2. **Register button should be visible** âœ…
3. Click register and complete booking
4. Go to "My Bookings" - should see your booking âœ…
