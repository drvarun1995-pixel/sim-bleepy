   - Click **"Run"** button
   - Wait for execution to complete

4. **Verify Success**
   - Look for these messages in output:
     ```
     ✅ Events system tables: RLS enabled with service role policies
     ✅ Junction tables: RLS enabled with service role policies
     ✅ Resources and communication tables: RLS enabled
     ✅ Stations and achievements: RLS enabled
     ✅ Gamification tables: RLS enabled
     ✅ SUCCESS: All tables have RLS enabled
     Tables with RLS enabled: 21
     ```

**If you see errors:** Check the error message and ensure you copied the entire file.

### Step 2: Fix SECURITY DEFINER Views (1 minute)

1. **In Supabase SQL Editor**
   - Open `migrations/fix-security-definer-views.sql`
   - Copy the **entire file contents**

     ✅ formats_with_counts: Recreated with security_invoker = true
     ✅ SUCCESS: All views recreated with security_invoker
     ```

---

### Step 3: Verify the Fix (2 minutes)

1. **Run verification script**
   - Open `verify-rls-enabled.sql`
   - Copy and paste into SQL Editor
   - Click **"Run"**

2. **Check the results**
   - Look for "✅ Enabled" next to all 21 tables
   - Verify policy count > 0 for each table
   - Check summary shows:
     ```
     Total Tables Checked: 21
     Tables with RLS Enabled: 21
     Tables with RLS DISABLED: 0
     ```

3. **Check Security Advisor**
   - Go to **Database → Advisors**
   - Verify it shows **0 errors** (was 44 before)
   - Take a screenshot for your records

### Step 4: Quick Smoke Test (2 minutes)

Run these 3 quick tests to ensure everything works:

**Test A: Organizer Deletion**
1. Login as Admin
2. Go to `/event-data`
3. Edit any event with organizers
4. Remove an organizer
5. Save and refresh page
6. ✅ Verify organizer stays removed

**Test B: Educator Upload**
1. Login as Educator
2. Try uploading a resource
3. ✅ Verify upload works

**Test C: Leaderboard**
1. Login as any user
2. View leaderboard
3. ✅ Verify shows multiple users

**If all 3 pass:** The fix is working! ✅

### Step 5: Full Testing (Optional - 40 minutes)

For comprehensive verification, follow `TESTING_CHECKLIST.md`:
- Tests all 6 previous bugs
- Tests all 5 user roles
- Tests gamification features
- Tests API endpoints
- Tests views

- ❌ 44 security errors
- ❌ RLS disabled on 24 tables
- ❌ 3 views with SECURITY DEFINER

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Table does not exist"
**Solution:** Some tables might not exist in your database. This is fine - the script uses `IF EXISTS` to handle this gracefully.

### Issue: "Permission denied"
**Solution:** Ensure you're using an account with sufficient privileges (project owner or admin).

### Issue: Verification shows RLS disabled
**Solution:** Re-run Step 1 (main migration). Check for any error messages.

### Issue: Security Advisor still shows errors
**Solution:** 
1. Refresh the Security Advisor page
2. Wait 1-2 minutes for cache to clear
3. Re-run verification script
4. Check which specific tables still have issues
