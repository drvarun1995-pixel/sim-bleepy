   - **Copy this ID** - you'll need it for the next step

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

1. **Add to Your Environment File**
   
   For **local development**, create/edit `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
   ```

2. **Add to Vercel (Production)**
   - Go to your Vercel project dashboard
   - Navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**
   - Add a new variable:
     - **Name**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID`
     - **Value**: `G-XXXXXXXXXX` (your Measurement ID)
     - **Environment**: Select `Production`, `Preview`, and `Development`
   - Click **Save**

3. **Redeploy Your Application**
   - After adding the environment variable, redeploy your app:
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```
   - Or push to your git repository to trigger automatic deployment

### 4. Verify Installation

1. **Test in Real-Time**
   - Go to Google Analytics
   - Navigate to **Reports** ‚Üí **Realtime**
   - Visit your website
   - You should see your visit appear in real-time (may take 10-30 seconds)

   - Open browser DevTools (F12)
   - Go to **Network** tab
   - Filter by `google-analytics.com` or `gtag`
   - You should see requests being sent

3. **Use Google Analytics Debugger**

   - Enable it and reload your page
   - Check the console for GA debug messages

## üìä What's Being Tracked

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### GA Not Tracking

**Problem**: No data appearing in Google Analytics

**Solutions**:
1. Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` is set correctly
2. Check that the ID starts with `G-` (not `UA-`)
3. Ensure you've redeployed after adding the environment variable
4. Check browser console for errors
5. Verify ad blockers aren't blocking GA scripts

### Events Not Showing

**Problem**: Page views work but custom events don't appear

**Solutions**:
1. Check that events are being called in your code
2. Verify event names match GA4 naming conventions (lowercase, underscores)
3. Wait 24-48 hours for events to appear in standard reports
4. Check **Realtime** reports for immediate feedback

### Duplicate Tracking

**Problem**: Seeing duplicate page views

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure GA script is only included once (in `layout.tsx`)
2. Check for conflicting GA implementations
3. Verify no browser extensions are injecting GA

## üîÑ Migration from Universal Analytics (UA)

If you're migrating from UA (tracking IDs starting with `UA-`):

1. **Create New GA4 Property** (don't delete UA yet)
2. **Run Both in Parallel** for comparison
3. **Update Environment Variable** to use GA4 ID
4. **Verify Data** matches between UA and GA4
5. **Sunset UA** after GA4 is validated
