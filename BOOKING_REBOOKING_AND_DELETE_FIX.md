# Booking System: Re-booking and Delete Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Re-booking After Cancellation
**Problem**: Users who cancelled a booking couldn't re-book the same event. The system showed "You already have a booking for this event" even though it was cancelled.

**Root Cause**: The `/api/bookings/check/[eventId]` endpoint was checking for ANY booking, including cancelled ones.

**Fix**: Updated the booking check query to exclude cancelled bookings:
```typescript
.eq('user_id', user.id)
.neq('status', 'cancelled')  // ← Added this filter
.maybeSingle();
```

**Files Modified**:
- `app/api/bookings/check/[eventId]/route.ts`

**Result**: Users can now re-book events after cancelling their previous booking!

### 2. ✅ Delete Booking Functionality
**Problem**: Users had no way to permanently delete their bookings from their "My Bookings" page.

**Fixes Applied**:

#### A. Updated DELETE API to Allow User Self-Deletion
Previously, only admins could delete bookings. Now users can delete their own bookings.

```typescript
// Users can only delete their own bookings, admins can delete any
if (!isAdmin && booking.user_id !== user.id) {
  return NextResponse.json({ 
    error: 'You can only delete your own bookings' 
  }, { status: 403 });
}
```

**Files Modified**:
- `app/api/bookings/[id]/route.ts`

#### B. Added Delete Button to My Bookings Page
Added a `handleDeleteBooking` function and a "Delete Booking" button that appears for ALL bookings (confirmed, cancelled, waitlist, attended, etc.).

**Features**:
- Red button with trash icon for clear visual distinction
- Confirmation dialog: "Are you sure you want to permanently delete this booking? This action cannot be undone."
- Loading state while deleting
- Success/error toast notifications
- Automatic refresh of bookings list after deletion

**Files Modified**:
- `app/my-bookings/page.tsx`

### 3. ⚠️ Access to `/bookings` Page (Reminder)
**Issue**: You mentioned you still get "Access Denied" on the `/bookings` page.

**Critical Action Required**: 
**You MUST log out and log back in** for the role to be included in your session. The role-based access control is working correctly, but your current session doesn't have the `role` field yet.

**Steps**:
1. Log out of your account
2. Log back in
3. Try accessing `/bookings` again

The access control is already properly configured for admin, meded_team, ctf, and educator roles.

## User Experience Improvements

### My Bookings Page Actions
Now users have three action buttons for each booking:

1. **View Event** (always shown)
   - Opens the event detail page
   - Outline button with external link icon

2. **Cancel Booking** (shown for upcoming confirmed/waitlist bookings)
   - Changes booking status to 'cancelled'
   - Orange button to indicate warning action
   - Allows user to re-book later

3. **Delete Booking** (always shown)
   - Permanently removes the booking from the database
   - Red button to indicate destructive action
   - Confirmation dialog to prevent accidents
   - Useful for cleaning up booking history
