## üìä What This Migration Does

### Adds 9 New Columns to `events` Table
```sql
booking_enabled                      (BOOLEAN - default: false)
booking_button_label                 (VARCHAR - default: 'Register')
booking_capacity                     (INTEGER - nullable)
booking_deadline_hours               (INTEGER - default: 1)
allow_waitlist                       (BOOLEAN - default: true)
confirmation_checkbox_1_text         (TEXT - default: confirmation message)
confirmation_checkbox_1_required     (BOOLEAN - default: true)
confirmation_checkbox_2_text         (TEXT - nullable)
confirmation_checkbox_2_required     (BOOLEAN - default: false)
```

### Creates `event_bookings` Table
- Stores all user bookings
- Tracks status (confirmed, waitlist, cancelled, attended, no-show)
- Prevents duplicate bookings per user per event
- Auto-updates timestamps

### Creates `event_booking_stats` View
- Pre-calculates booking statistics
- Shows capacity utilization
- Fast queries for admin dashboard

### Sets Up 6 RLS Policies
- Users can view/manage own bookings
- Admins can view/manage all bookings
- Proper security boundaries

## üîç Verification

After running the migration, you should see this output at the end:

```
‚úÖ MIGRATION SUCCESSFUL!
=====================================================
All booking system components installed correctly.

Next Steps:
1. Go to Event Data page
2. Edit an event and go to "Booking" tab
3. Enable booking and configure settings
4. Test booking on the event page
=====================================================
```

And this table:

| status | count |
|--------|-------|
| Events with booking enabled | 0 |
| Total bookings | 0 |
| Confirmed bookings | 0 |
| Waitlist bookings | 0 |

## ‚ùì What If Something Goes Wrong?

### Scenario 1: "Column already exists" warnings
**This is normal!** The migration checks for existing columns and skips them.

You'll see:
```
‚ö† booking_enabled column already exists, skipping
```

**This is SAFE** - it means you've run the migration before or the column was manually added.

### Scenario 2: Transaction error
If ANY error occurs, the **entire migration will rollback** automatically.

Your database will be **exactly as it was** before running the script.

### Scenario 3: Permission denied
You need to be logged in as the **project owner** or have **database admin** permissions.

### Scenario 4: Foreign key constraint error
Make sure you have:
- ‚úÖ `users` table with `id` and `role` columns
- ‚úÖ `events` table

These should already exist from your base schema.

---

## üîß Manual Verification (Optional)

If you want to double-check everything was created correctly:

### Check Events Table Columns
```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type, column_default 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'events' 
AND column_name LIKE 'booking%'
ORDER BY column_name;
```

**Expected:** 9 rows returned

### Check event_bookings Table
```sql
SELECT EXISTS (
  SELECT FROM information_schema.tables 
  WHERE table_name = 'event_bookings'
);
```

**Expected:** `true`

### Check RLS Policies
```sql
SELECT policyname 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'event_bookings';
```

**Expected:** 6 policies

### Check View
```sql
SELECT EXISTS (
  SELECT FROM information_schema.views 
  WHERE table_name = 'event_booking_stats'
);
```

**Expected:** `true`

## üìù What About the Other 4 Migration Files?

You can **IGNORE** these files:
- `migrations/add-event-booking-fields.sql`
- `migrations/create-event-bookings-table.sql`
- `migrations/create-booking-stats-view.sql`
- `migrations/setup-booking-rls-policies.sql`

The **SAFE_BOOKING_SYSTEM_MIGRATION.sql** file **combines all 4** into one safe script.

## üÜò Need Help?

### Common Issues

**Q: Can I run this migration multiple times?**  
A: Yes! It's 100% safe. It will skip anything that already exists.

**Q: Will this affect my existing events?**  
A: No! Booking is OFF by default. Existing events won't change.

**Q: Can I rollback if I don't like it?**  
A: Yes, but you'd need to manually drop the table and columns (not recommended after going live).

**Q: Does this delete any data?**  
A: No! This is a pure addition. No deletions anywhere.

**Q: Will users see booking buttons immediately?**  
A: No. You must enable booking per event in the Booking tab.
