## ✅ What's Done

1. ✅ Certificate email function added (using your Microsoft Graph API)
2. ✅ Certificate utilities and TypeScript types created
3. ✅ Dashboard sidebar updated with "Certificates" and "My Certificates" links
4. ✅ Main certificates page updated with Generate/Manage buttons
5. ✅ Database migration created and ready to run
6. ✅ Complete implementation guide written

## 🚀 What You Need To Do (10 minutes)

### 1. Run Database Migrations
**Migration 1:** `migrations/create-certificates-system.sql`
- Copy & paste into Supabase SQL Editor → RUN
- Verify: `SELECT * FROM certificates;` (empty, not error)

**Migration 2:** `migrations/create-certificate-templates-table.sql`
- Copy & paste into Supabase SQL Editor → RUN
- Verify: `SELECT * FROM certificate_templates;` (empty, not error)

### 2. Create Storage Bucket
- Supabase → Storage → New bucket
- Name: `certificates` (private)
- Add 3 RLS policies (provided in WHAT_YOU_NEED_TO_DO_CERTIFICATES.md)

### 3. Test
- Start dev server: `npm run dev`
- Check sidebar for new links
- Visit `/certificates` - should see new buttons

## 🔜 What I'll Build Next (After You're Done)

1. **Generate Page** - Select event, template, attendees → bulk generate → send emails
2. **Manage Page** - View all, filter, download, resend, delete
3. **My Certificates Page** - User view of their certificates
4. **API Routes** - Backend endpoints for all operations

## 📧 Email Flow

Certificates will be sent via your existing **Microsoft Graph API** using **support@bleepy.co.uk** with a beautiful HTML template showing:
- Congratulations message
- Event details
- Download button
- Certificate ID
- Link to dashboard

## 🔒 Security

**Certificates:**
- Students: View/download own certificates only
- Educators: View all certificates
- MedEd Team/CTF: Generate, view, send certificates
- Admin: Full access including delete

**Templates:**
- Admin: Can see ALL templates (everyone's)
- MedEd Team: Can see ONLY their own templates
- CTF: Can see ONLY their own templates
- Educator: Can see ONLY their own templates (future)

## ⏱️ Timeline

- **You**: 10 minutes (run migration, create bucket, test)
- **Me**: 30-45 minutes (build all pages & API routes)

**When you're done with Steps 1-3, just say:**
"Done! Steps 1-3 complete"

And I'll build everything else! 🚀
