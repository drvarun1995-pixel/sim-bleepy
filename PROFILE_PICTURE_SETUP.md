# Profile Picture Feature - Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up and use the profile picture feature with Supabase Storage.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Profile Pictures**: Upload, crop, and display circular profile pictures
- **Bio Fields**: Add optional "About Me" and "Tagline" to profiles
- **Client-Side Optimization**: Images are compressed from 2-3MB to 200-300KB before upload
- **Zero Server Load**: All processing happens in the browser
- **Modern UX**: Touch-friendly image cropper with zoom controls
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time upload progress bar
- **Toast Notifications**: User feedback for all actions

## üìã Prerequisites

- Supabase project with database access
- Environment variables configured (see `.env.local`)
- Node.js project with dependencies installed

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

The required packages are already installed:
- `react-easy-crop` - Modern image cropper
- `browser-image-compression` - Client-side compression

If not installed, run:
```bash
npm install react-easy-crop browser-image-compression
```

### Step 2: Database Migration

Run the SQL migration in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- File: migrations/add-profile-picture-and-bio-fields.sql

-- Add profile picture columns
ALTER TABLE users 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS profile_picture_url TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS profile_picture_updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS about_me TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS tagline VARCHAR(255);

-- Add comments for documentation
COMMENT ON COLUMN users.profile_picture_url IS 'URL to user profile picture in Supabase Storage';
COMMENT ON COLUMN users.profile_picture_updated_at IS 'Timestamp of last profile picture update';
COMMENT ON COLUMN users.about_me IS 'User bio/about me section (optional)';
COMMENT ON COLUMN users.tagline IS 'Short tagline/headline for user profile (optional, max 255 chars)';

-- Create index for faster profile picture lookups
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_users_profile_picture_url ON users(profile_picture_url) WHERE profile_picture_url IS NOT NULL;
```

### Step 3: Create Supabase Storage Bucket

#### Option A: Using Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to **Storage** in the left sidebar
3. Click **"Create bucket"**
4. Configure the bucket:
   - **Name**: `profile-pictures`
   - **Public bucket**: ‚úÖ Yes (allows public read access)
   - **File size limit**: 3MB (3145728 bytes)
   - **Allowed MIME types**: `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/webp`

#### Option B: Using SQL

Run this in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- Insert bucket configuration
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public, file_size_limit, allowed_mime_types)
VALUES (
  'profile-pictures',
  'profile-pictures',
  true,
  3145728, -- 3MB in bytes
  ARRAY['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/webp']
)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;
```

### Step 4: Configure Storage RLS Policies

Run these RLS policies in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- File: migrations/setup-profile-pictures-bucket.sql

-- Policy 1: Allow authenticated users to upload their own profile pictures
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload their own profile picture"
ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'profile-pictures' 
  AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);

-- Policy 2: Allow users to update their own profile pictures
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own profile picture"
ON storage.objects
FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'profile-pictures' 
  AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);

-- Policy 3: Allow users to delete their own profile pictures
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own profile picture"
ON storage.objects
FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'profile-pictures' 
  AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);

-- Policy 4: Allow public read access to all profile pictures
CREATE POLICY "Public read access to profile pictures"
ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'profile-pictures');
```

### Step 5: Verify Setup

1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to your profile page
3. Try uploading a profile picture
4. Check Supabase Storage to confirm the file was uploaded

   - Compressed to ~200-300KB (WebP format)
   - Uploaded to Supabase Storage
   - Database updated with URL
   - Progress bar shows upload status
   - Success toast notification
6. Profile picture appears in circular avatar

### Delete Flow

2. File deleted from Supabase Storage
3. Database record cleared
4. Avatar shows user initial
5. Success toast notification

## ‚ö° Performance Optimizations

### Client-Side Processing
- ‚úÖ Image cropping happens in browser (Canvas API)
- ‚úÖ Compression reduces file size by 85-90%
- ‚úÖ WebP format for better compression
- ‚úÖ Direct upload to Supabase Storage (no server proxy)

### Server Load
- ‚úÖ Zero CPU usage for image processing
- ‚úÖ Minimal API overhead (only metadata updates)
- ‚úÖ No temporary file storage
- ‚úÖ CDN-delivered images (Supabase Storage)

### Database Efficiency
- ‚úÖ Indexed profile_picture_url for fast lookups
- ‚úÖ Automatic cleanup of old files
- ‚úÖ One file per user (overwrites on update)

## üîí Security

### Authentication
- All endpoints require valid session
- Users can only access their own data
- Service role key used for storage operations

### File Validation
- File type checking (JPEG, PNG, WebP only)
- File size limit (3MB max)
- MIME type validation
- User ownership verification

### Storage Security
- RLS policies enforce ownership
- Public read-only for viewing
- Authenticated write for own files
- Folder-based isolation per user

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Upload Fails

**Issue**: "Failed to upload image to storage"

**Solutions**:
1. Check Supabase Storage bucket exists
2. Verify bucket name is `profile-pictures`
3. Confirm bucket is public
4. Check RLS policies are active

### RLS Permission Denied

**Issue**: "new row violates row-level security policy"

**Solutions**:
1. Run all RLS policies from Step 4
2. Check user is authenticated
3. Verify `auth.uid()` matches user folder

### Image Not Displaying

**Issue**: Profile picture URL exists but image doesn't load

**Solutions**:
1. Check bucket is marked as public
2. Verify "Public read access" policy exists
3. Check browser console for CORS errors
4. Try accessing URL directly in browser

### Compression Too Aggressive

**Issue**: Compressed images look pixelated

**Solutions**:
1. Increase `maxSizeMB` in ProfilePictureUpload.tsx (line 150)
2. Adjust WebP quality parameter (line 60)
3. Increase final dimensions from 400x400

## üéØ Usage Example

```tsx
// In any profile page component
import { ProfileForm } from '@/components/profile/ProfileForm'

export default function ProfilePage() {
  const [profile, setProfile] = useState(null)

  const fetchProfile = async () => {
    const response = await fetch('/api/user/profile')
    const data = await response.json()
    setProfile(data.user)
  }

  return (
    <ProfileForm 
      initialProfile={profile} 
      onUpdate={fetchProfile} 
    />
  )
}
```
