# 🚨 URGENT: RLS Fix Required

## ⚡ Quick Summary

After enabling RLS for security compliance, **event management is broken**. You're seeing these errors:

```
❌ new row violates row-level security policy for table "organizers"
❌ new row violates row-level security policy for table "events"
❌ new row violates row-level security policy for table "locations"
❌ new row violates row-level security policy for table "speakers"
```

## 🔧 The Fix (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Run This SQL Script

1. Open **Supabase SQL Editor**
2. Open file: **`migrations/fix-rls-authenticated-user-policies.sql`**
3. Copy all contents
4. Paste into SQL Editor
5. Click **Run**

### Step 2: Verify It Worked

Run this in SQL Editor:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as policies_created 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND policyname LIKE 'Authenticated users%';
```

**Expected Result:** `33`

### Step 3: Test It

## 🎯 Why This Happened

The previous RLS fix only added **service role policies**, which work for API routes but not for frontend client-side operations.

The frontend uses `lib/events-api.ts` which makes direct Supabase calls as an **authenticated user**, not as service role.

This fix adds **authenticated user policies** that check user roles before allowing operations.

## 🆘 If You Still Have Issues

1. Check your user role:
```sql
SELECT email, role FROM users WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
```
Should be `admin`, `educator`, `meded`, or `ctf`.

2. Check the full troubleshooting guide in: **`RLS_AUTHENTICATED_USER_FIX_COMPLETE.md`**

**Status:** 🔴 Critical - Apply immediately to restore event management functionality

**Time to Fix:** ⏱️ 5 minutes

**Risk Level:** 🟢 Low - Only adds new policies, doesn't modify existing ones
