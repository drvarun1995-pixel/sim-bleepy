2. **Event Date**: In YYYY-MM-DD format
3. **Start Time**: In 24-hour format (HH:MM)
4. **End Time**: In 24-hour format (HH:MM)
5. **Description**: Brief description if found

### ✅ AI WILL Match:
1. **Locations**: Against existing database entries
2. **Speakers**: Against existing database entries

### ❌ AI WILL NOT:
1. Create new locations
2. Create new speakers
3. Create new categories
4. Create new formats
5. Create new organizers
6. Modify existing database entries
7. Extract email addresses (removed for privacy)
8. Make assumptions about missing data
9. Create duplicate entries

### 👤 User Must Assign:
1. **Category**: From existing options
2. **Format**: From existing options
3. **Organizer**: From existing options

These are assigned manually during the review step.
