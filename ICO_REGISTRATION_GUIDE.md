## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 What is ICO Registration?

The **Information Commissioner's Office (ICO)** is the UK's independent authority for data protection. Organizations that process personal data may be required to register with the ICO and pay a data protection fee.

### 1.2 Do We Need to Register?

**Status:** ⚠️ **Pending Decision**

**Factors to Consider:**
- Are you a data controller or data processor?
- Do you process personal data?
- Are you exempt from registration?
- What is your annual turnover?

### 1.3 Current Assessment

**Likely Status:** Registration **MAY BE REQUIRED**

**Reasoning:**
- You process personal data (user accounts, bookings, etc.)
- You are likely a data controller (determining purposes of processing)
- You may not be exempt

**Action Required:** Determine requirement and register if needed

---

## 2. Registration Requirements

### 2.1 When Registration is Required

You **MUST** register if:
- You process personal data
- You are a data controller
- You are not exempt
- You are not a public authority (different rules)

### 2.2 When Registration is NOT Required

You **DO NOT** need to register if:
- You only process personal data for:
  - Staff administration
  - Advertising, marketing and public relations (for your own business)
  - Accounts and records (for your own business)
  - Not-for-profit purposes
  - Personal, family or household affairs
  - Maintaining a public register
  - Judicial functions
  - Processing personal information without an automated system

**Note:** Most businesses processing customer data WILL need to register.

### 2.3 For NHS Suppliers

**Important:** Even if you process data on behalf of NHS trusts (as a data processor), you may still need to register if you also act as a data controller for your own purposes (e.g., user accounts, analytics).
