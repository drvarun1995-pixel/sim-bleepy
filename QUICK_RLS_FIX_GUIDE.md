# ⚡ Quick Fix: Enable Proper RLS for All Roles

## 🎯 What You Need to Do

Your database currently has **RLS DISABLED** as a temporary workaround. This migration will **properly secure your database** while giving all roles the correct permissions.

---

## 📋 Simple 3-Step Process

### **Step 1: Open Supabase SQL Editor** 🔍

1. Go to your [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com)
2. Select your project
3. Click **"SQL Editor"** in the left sidebar
4. Click **"New Query"**

---

### **Step 2: Run First Migration** 🗄️

**File:** `migrations/add-meded-ctf-roles.sql`

1. Open the file in your code editor
2. **Copy ALL the SQL** (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C)
3. **Paste** into Supabase SQL Editor
4. Click **"Run"** or press `Ctrl+Enter`
5. ✅ Should see success message

**What this does:**
- Adds `meded_team` and `ctf` to allowed roles
- Updates database constraints
- Creates index for role filtering

---

### **Step 3: Run Second Migration** 🔐

**File:** `migrations/comprehensive-rls-all-roles.sql`

1. Open the file in your code editor
2. **Copy ALL the SQL** (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C)
3. **Paste** into Supabase SQL Editor
4. Click **"Run"** or press `Ctrl+Enter`
5. ✅ You should see detailed success messages showing:
   - Tables with RLS enabled
   - Policy count
   - Role permissions summary

**What this does:**
- Creates helper functions for role checking
- Enables RLS on all tables
- Creates comprehensive security policies for ALL roles
- Makes sure students, educators, meded_team, ctf, and admin all work correctly

---

## ✅ Verify It Worked

After running both migrations, check:

```sql
-- Quick verification query
SELECT 
    tablename,
    rowsecurity as rls_enabled
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
AND tablename IN ('events', 'categories', 'formats', 'resources', 'contact_messages')
ORDER BY tablename;
```

**Expected result:** All should show `rls_enabled = true` ✅

---

## 🧪 Test the New Roles

### **Assign Test Users:**
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor
UPDATE users SET role = 'meded_team' WHERE email = 'test1@example.com';
UPDATE users SET role = 'ctf' WHERE email = 'test2@example.com';
```

### **Test Access:**
1. Log in as MedEd Team user
2. Navigate to:
   - ✅ `/bulk-upload-ai` - Should work!
   - ✅ `/formats` - Should work!
   - ✅ `/contact-messages` - Should work!
3. Try creating an event - Should work!
4. Try uploading a resource - Should work!

## 🎭 What Each Role Can Do Now

### 🟢 **Student:**
- View published events
- View active resources
- Use AI simulator (3 attempts/day)
- Manage own profile and portfolio

### 🔵 **Educator:**
- Everything students can do
- Upload/edit/delete resources
- View all events (including drafts)
- Unlimited simulator attempts

### 🟣 **MedEd Team:**
- Everything educators can do
- Create/edit/delete events
- Manage categories, formats, locations, organizers
- View and manage contact messages
- Access admin event tools

### 🟠 **CTF:**
- Same as MedEd Team (identical permissions)

### 🔴 **Admin:**

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Email Notifications**: Temporarily disabled as you requested
   - To enable later: Uncomment code in `app/api/admin/users/route.ts`

2. **No Data Loss**: This migration only updates policies, doesn't touch your data

3. **Backward Compatible**: All existing features continue to work

4. **Service Role**: Your backend API will still work correctly
