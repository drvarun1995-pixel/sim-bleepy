- **Issue:** Image lightbox on mobile was disappearing after opening, leaving only the modal backdrop

  5. Improved image loading error handling with retry functionality
  6. Added safety checks in navigation button handlers
  7. Added `aria-label` attributes to navigation buttons for better accessibility
