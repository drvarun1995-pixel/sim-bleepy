# ✅ RLS Authenticated User Fix - Complete Guide

## 🚨 Problem Summary

After enabling RLS for Supabase Security Advisor compliance, the following operations **FAILED** with RLS policy violations:

### ❌ Errors Encountered:

1. **Creating Organizers**: `new row violates row-level security policy for table "organizers"`
2. **Creating Events**: `new row violates row-level security policy for table "events"`
3. **Creating Locations**: `new row violates row-level security policy for table "locations"`
4. **Creating Speakers**: `new row violates row-level security policy for table "speakers"`
5. **Creating Categories**: `new row violates row-level security policy for table "categories"`
6. **Creating Formats**: `new row violates row-level security policy for table "formats"`
7. **Leaderboard XP Not Updating**: XP transactions not being recorded

---

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### Why Did This Happen?

The previous RLS fix (`migrations/fix-supabase-security-advisor.sql`) only added **service role policies**:

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Service role full access"
  ON public.events FOR ALL
  USING (auth.role() = 'service_role')
  WITH CHECK (auth.role() = 'service_role');
```

**The Problem:**
- ✅ **API routes** use `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` → Work fine
- ❌ **Frontend client** uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` → Blocked by RLS

### Where Frontend Uses Client-Side Supabase:

**File: `lib/events-api.ts`**
```typescript
import { createClient } from '@/utils/supabase/client';
const supabase = createClient(); // Uses anon key, runs as authenticated user

export async function createOrganizer(name: string) {
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('organizers')
    .insert([{ name }])  // ❌ BLOCKED BY RLS
    .select()
    .single();
  
  if (error) throw error;
  return data;
}
```

**Used By:**
- `/event-data` page (Event Management Interface)
- All create/edit/delete operations for events, organizers, locations, speakers, etc.

---

## ✅ The Solution

### Created Migration: `migrations/fix-rls-authenticated-user-policies.sql`

This migration adds **INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE policies** for authenticated users with proper roles.

### What It Does:

1. **Allows authenticated users with roles** (`admin`, `educator`, `meded`, `ctf`) to:
   - INSERT new records
   - UPDATE existing records
   - DELETE records

2. **Maintains security** by:
   - Checking user role from `users` table
   - Only allowing specific roles to manage events
   - Keeping service role policies intact

3. **Covers all affected tables**:
   - `events`
   - `categories`
   - `formats`
   - `locations`
   - `organizers`
   - `speakers`
   - `event_categories` (junction)
   - `event_formats` (junction)
   - `event_locations` (junction)
   - `event_organizers` (junction)
   - `event_speakers` (junction)
   - `resources`

### Example Policy:

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can insert organizers"
  ON public.organizers FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM public.users
      WHERE users.email = auth.jwt() ->> 'email'
      AND users.role IN ('admin', 'educator', 'meded', 'ctf')
    )
  );
```

**How It Works:**
1. Policy applies to `authenticated` users (anyone logged in)
2. Checks if user's email (from NextAuth JWT) exists in `users` table
3. Verifies user has one of the allowed roles
4. If yes → Allow INSERT
5. If no → Block INSERT

---

## 📋 How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Run the Migration

1. Open **Supabase SQL Editor**
2. Open file: `migrations/fix-rls-authenticated-user-policies.sql`
3. Copy the entire contents
4. Paste into SQL Editor
5. Click **Run**

### Step 2: Verify the Fix

Run this query in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
SELECT 
    tablename,
    COUNT(*) as policy_count
FROM pg_policies
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
  AND policyname LIKE 'Authenticated users%'
GROUP BY tablename
ORDER BY tablename;
```

**Expected Output:**
```
tablename              | policy_count
-----------------------+-------------
categories             | 3
event_categories       | 2
event_formats          | 2
event_locations        | 2
event_organizers       | 2
event_speakers         | 2
events                 | 3
formats                | 3
locations              | 3
organizers             | 3
resources              | 3
speakers               | 3
```

Total: **33 policies**

### Step 3: Test the Fix

#### Test 1: Create Organizer
1. Log in as admin/educator/meded user
2. Go to `/event-data`
3. Click "Organizers" tab
4. Click "Add Organizer"
5. Enter name and save
6. ✅ Should work without errors

#### Test 2: Create Location
1. Go to "Locations" tab
2. Click "Add Location"
3. Enter location details
4. ✅ Should work without errors

#### Test 3: Create Speaker
1. Go to "Speakers" tab
2. Click "Add Speaker"
3. Enter speaker details
4. ✅ Should work without errors

#### Test 4: Create Event
1. Go to "Events" tab
2. Click "Create Event"
3. Fill in event details
4. Select organizer, location, speakers
5. Click "Create Event"
6. ✅ Should work without errors

#### Test 5: Leaderboard XP
1. Complete a scenario (e.g., chest-pain)
2. Check `/dashboard/gamification`
3. ✅ XP should be updated
4. ✅ Leaderboard should show new XP

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### ✅ What's Protected:

1. **Role-Based Access Control**
   - Only `admin`, `educator`, `meded`, `ctf` can manage events
   - Regular `student` users cannot create/edit/delete events
   - Unauthenticated users have no access

2. **Service Role Still Works**
   - API routes using service role key work as before
   - No changes to backend functionality

3. **User Isolation**
   - Gamification tables still have user isolation policies
   - Users can only see their own XP, achievements, etc.

### ❌ What's NOT a Security Risk:

1. **"Authenticated users can insert"** sounds broad, but:
   - Policy checks user role from database
   - Only specific roles are allowed
   - Not all authenticated users can insert

2. **Frontend client access** is safe because:
   - User must be logged in (NextAuth)
   - User must have correct role in database
   - RLS enforces role check on every operation

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still getting RLS errors after applying fix

**Solution 1: Check user role**
```sql
SELECT id, email, name, role FROM users WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
```
Ensure role is `admin`, `educator`, `meded`, or `ctf`.

**Solution 2: Check policies exist**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND policyname LIKE 'Authenticated users%';
```
Should return **33**.

**Solution 3: Check RLS is enabled**
```sql
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND tablename IN ('events', 'organizers', 'locations', 'speakers');
```
All should show `t` (true).

**Solution 4: Check JWT token**
In browser console:
```javascript
fetch('/api/auth/session').then(r => r.json()).then(console.log)
```
Should show: `{ user: { email: '...', name: '...', ... } }`

### Issue: Leaderboard XP not updating

**Solution 1: Check gamification functions exist**
```sql
SELECT proname FROM pg_proc WHERE proname = 'award_xp';
```
Should return `award_xp`.

**Solution 2: Check xp_transactions table**
```sql
SELECT * FROM xp_transactions ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
```
Should show recent XP transactions.

**Solution 3: Check user_levels table**
```sql
SELECT * FROM user_levels WHERE user_id = (
  SELECT id FROM users WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com'
);
```
Should show user's current level and XP.

**Solution 4: Check service role key**
Ensure `.env.local` has:
```
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJ...
```
