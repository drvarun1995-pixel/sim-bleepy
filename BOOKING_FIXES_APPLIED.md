# Booking System Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Access Denied on `/bookings` Page
**Problem**: Admin users couldn't access the bookings management page.

**Root Cause**: The `role` field was not being included in the NextAuth session object.

**Fix**: Updated `lib/auth.ts` to include the `role` field in:
- The database SELECT query
- The user object returned from `authorize()`
- The JWT token via the `jwt()` callback
- The session object via the `session()` callback

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/auth.ts`

**What This Means**: 
- You need to **log out and log back in** for the role to be included in your session
- After re-login, admin/educator/meded_team/ctf users can access `/bookings`

### 2. ✅ Controlled/Uncontrolled Input Warning
**Problem**: React warning about components changing from uncontrolled to controlled inputs when activating booking on event-data page.

**Root Cause**: When loading existing events from the database that don't have booking data yet (columns are new), the fields return `undefined` or `null`, which React interprets as an uncontrolled input initially.

**Fix**: Added nullish coalescing operators (`??`) to ensure all checkbox inputs always have boolean values:
- `bookingEnabled ?? false`
- `allowWaitlist ?? true`
- `confirmationCheckbox1Required ?? true`
- `confirmationCheckbox2Required ?? false`

Also added default values to text inputs:
- `bookingButtonLabel || 'Register'`
- `bookingDeadlineHours || 1`
- `confirmationCheckbox1Text || 'I confirm my attendance at this event'`
- `confirmationCheckbox2Text || ''`

**Files Modified**:
- `app/event-data/page.tsx`

**What This Means**:
- No more React warnings in the console
- The "Activate Booking" checkbox will now stay checked after saving
- All booking fields will properly persist their values

### 3. ✅ My Bookings Sidebar Position
**Fix**: Moved "My Bookings" below "Formats" in the dashboard sidebar navigation.

**Files Modified**:
- `components/dashboard/DashboardSidebar.tsx`

---

### 4. ✅ API Errors on My Bookings Page
**Fix**: Removed references to `location_name` and `location_address` columns that don't exist in the events table.

**Files Modified**:
- `app/api/bookings/route.ts`
- `app/my-bookings/page.tsx`

---

## Required Actions

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Log Out and Log Back In
**You must log out and log back in for the role to be included in your session.**

After re-login:
1. Navigate to `/bookings` as admin - should work now
2. Try activating booking on an event - checkbox should stay checked
3. Visit `/my-bookings` - should load without errors

---

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Log out and log back in
- [ ] Access `/bookings` page as admin
- [ ] Go to event-data page and activate booking for an event
- [ ] Save the event and refresh - booking should still be enabled
- [ ] Visit `/my-bookings` page - should load without errors
- [ ] Check browser console - no more controlled/uncontrolled warnings
