ALTER TABLE public.locations DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

## üìã Testing Steps

1. **Calendar Design**:
   - Go to home page or calendar page
   - Check if month names show on prev/next buttons
   - If not, hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

2. **Organizer Deletion** (AFTER running SQL):
   - Go to event-data management
   - Edit an event
   - Remove an organizer
   - Save
   - Refresh page
   - Verify organizer is still removed ‚úì

3. **Dashboard Calendar**:
   - Go to /dashboard
   - Look at the calendar on the right
   - Click any date with events (purple dots)
   - Events should appear below calendar
   - Click an event to view details

4. **Home Page Calendar**:
   - Go to home page (/)
   - Scroll to calendar section
   - Click any date
   - Event list should appear below

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT

**The organizer deletion fix requires you to run the SQL script!**

The code changes are complete, but the database Row Level Security (RLS) policies need to be disabled for:
- `organizers` table
- `event_organizers` table (junction table)
- `locations` table
- `event_locations` table

Without running the SQL, organizer deletions will continue to revert.
